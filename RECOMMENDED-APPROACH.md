# ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Approach: Docker Solution First

## **Why Docker First?**

1. **Already Running** âœ… - The container is up and healthy with `0.0.0.0` binding
2. **No Additional Setup** âœ… - Just test and use existing Claude Desktop config
3. **Quick Test** âœ… - Takes 30 seconds to verify
4. **Preserves Architecture** âœ… - Keeps your containerized design intact

---

## **Step 1: Quick Windows Test (30 seconds)**

Open **Windows Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```cmd
curl http://localhost:6174/health
```

### **If you see this response, YOU'RE DONE!**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "unified-neural-mcp-server"
}
```

Then just restart Claude Desktop with your existing config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neural-ai-collaboration": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch", "http://localhost:6174/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## **Step 2: Only if Docker Fails â†’ PowerShell Native**

If the Docker test fails, THEN we implement your PowerShell suggestion:

```bash
# Copy to Windows
cp -r /home/tomcat65/projects/shared-memory-mcp /mnt/c/neural-mcp/
```

Then use the PowerShell config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neural-ai-collaboration": {
      "command": "powershell",
      "args": ["-NoProfile", "-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-Command", "cd C:\\neural-mcp; node dist/unified-neural-mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## **Why This Order Makes Sense**

| Approach | Setup Time | Complexity | Maintenance |
|----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Docker (Current)** | 0 min âœ… | Low | Automatic |
| **PowerShell Native** | 10 min | Medium | Manual |

**Docker is already configured with `0.0.0.0` binding, which SHOULD work from Windows.**

## **ACTION: Run This Now**

From Windows Command Prompt:
```cmd
curl http://localhost:6174/health
```

**Let me know the result, and we'll proceed accordingly!**
