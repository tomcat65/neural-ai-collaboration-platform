## 🔄 **Step 5: Alternative - Merge to Main Locally**

If you want to merge to main branch locally:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Merge your feature branch
git merge feature/phase3-multi-provider

# Push updated main branch
git push origin main
```

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Workflow**

I recommend the **Pull Request approach**:

1. **Push feature branch** to GitHub
2. **Create Pull Request** for review
3. **Merge via GitHub** interface
4. **Delete feature branch** after merge
5. **Pull updated main** locally

This maintains a clean git history and allows for code review.
