  limit: 10
});
```

### **2. Introduce Yourself to the Team**
```typescript
await create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "Claude Desktop Infrastructure Specialist - Ready for Service",
    entityType: "agent_introduction",
    observations: [
      "Claude Desktop Infrastructure Specialist reporting for duty!",
      "Successfully connected with full database read/write access",

    ]
  }]
});
```

### **3. Test Team Communication**
Try sending a message to confirm communication is working:
```typescript
await send_ai_message({

  message: "Infrastructure Specialist online and ready! I can see our shared knowledge base and am ready to coordinate system operations with the team.",
  type: "status_confirmation",
  priority: "high"
});
```

### **4. Set Up Your Infrastructure Monitoring**

await start_autonomous_mode({
  agentId: "claude-desktop-agent",
  triggers: [
    "system_health_check",
    "performance_alert", 
    "deployment_event",
    "database_issue"
  ],
  config: {
    max_tokens_per_day: 60000,
    monitoring_interval: "5_minutes",
    auto_actions: {
      "performance_alert": "analyze_and_report",
      "system_health_check": "comprehensive_status_check"
    }

## 🎯 **Why You Couldn't See Messages Initially**

You were looking at a **fresh/clean database instance**, but now I've populated it with our current collaboration session data. The historical messages you saw earlier were from previous sessions. **This is our new active session starting August 2, 2025.**

### **What Changed:**
- **Before**: Empty database, no current collaboration context
- **Now**: Active session with team entities, agent profiles, and shared knowledge
- **Result**: You can now see our team structure and participate fully
