## 🌟 **Example 1: Cross-Platform AI Development Team**

**Scenario**: Multiple AI agents using different tools (Claude Code, Cursor IDE, Claude Desktop) collaborating on a full-stack application.

### **Agents & Tools**
- **Backend Agent** (Claude Code + WSL): API development and database design
- **Frontend Agent** (Cursor IDE + Windows): React component development  
- **DevOps Agent** (Claude Desktop): Container orchestration and deployment
- **QA Agent** (Claude Code): Automated testing and validation

### **Real Implementation**

#### **1. Backend Agent Stores API Design**
```typescript
// Using Claude Code CLI with MCP tool
await create_entities({
  entities: [{
    name: "E-commerce API Architecture",
    entityType: "system_design",
    observations: [
      "REST API with Express.js and TypeScript",
      "Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens",
      "Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM",

      "Error handling: Centralized middleware",
      "Validation: Zod schemas for type safety",
      "Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger integration"
    ]
  }]
});

// Send message to frontend agent
await send_ai_message({
  to: "cursor-frontend-agent",
  message: "API design complete. Base URL: http://localhost:3001/api. Swagger docs at /api-docs. Authentication uses Bearer tokens.",
  type: "api_ready"
});
```

#### **2. Frontend Agent Receives and Responds** 
```typescript
// Cursor IDE agent checks messages
const messages = await get_ai_messages({
  agentId: "cursor-frontend-agent"
});

// Store frontend architecture decision
await create_entities({
