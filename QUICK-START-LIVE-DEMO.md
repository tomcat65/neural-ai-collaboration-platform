## üéØ Live Demo Script

### **Demo Flow (10 minutes total)**

#### **Part 1: System Validation (2 minutes)**

**In Claude Desktop or Cursor, ask:**
```
Can you verify that the neural-ai-collaboration MCP server is connected and list the available tools?
```

**Expected Response:** List of 27 tools with capabilities

#### **Part 2: Memory & Knowledge Demo (2 minutes)**

```
Create an entity called "LiveDemo2024" with type "demonstration" and observations about this being a live demo of the Neural AI Collaboration system with advanced memory capabilities.
```

```
Search for entities related to "demo" and show me what you find.
```

#### **Part 3: Multi-Provider AI Demo (2 minutes)**

```
Execute an AI request using automatic provider selection to generate three creative names for an AI collaboration platform, and show me which provider was chosen and why.
```

```
Get the current status of all AI providers including their health, response times, and costs.
```

#### **Part 4: Autonomous Agents Demo (2 minutes)**

```
Register a new agent called "DemoBot" with capabilities for demonstration, testing, and user engagement.
```

```
Start autonomous mode for DemoBot with a token budget of 1000 and configure it for reactive monitoring.
```

#### **Part 5: Cross-Platform & Advanced Features (2 minutes)**

```
Translate the Windows path "C:\Users\Demo\Documents\project.txt" to WSL format and then generate MCP configurations for both Claude Desktop and Cursor.
```

```
Get comprehensive system status including performance metrics, memory usage, and all active capabilities.
```
