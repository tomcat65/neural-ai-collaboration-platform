# ✅ CURSOR MCP SETUP - WORKING!

## 🎯 The Solution That Works

Your custom STDIO bridge (`mcp-stdio-bridge.cjs`) successfully connects Windows Cursor to WSL2 Docker MCP server!

---

## 📝 Cursor Configuration

The `.cursor/mcp.json` is already configured:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "neural-ai-collaboration": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\neural-mcp\\mcp-stdio-bridge.cjs"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Final Steps for Cursor

1. **Open Cursor from the project directory:**
   ```cmd
   cd C:\neural-mcp
   cursor .
   ```

2. **Enable MCP in Cursor:**
   - Press `Ctrl + ,` (Settings)
   - Go to **Features** → **Model Context Protocol**
   - **Enable** MCP servers

3. **Switch to Agent Mode:**
   - In the chat interface, click the mode selector
   - Choose **Agent** (not Ask or Chat)
   - MCP only works in Agent Mode!

4. **Check MCP Status:**
   - Settings → MCP
   - You should see "neural-ai-collaboration" with a green status
   - If red, restart Cursor

5. **Test in Cursor:**
   Ask: "What MCP tools are available from the neural-ai-collaboration server?"

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ **Windows to WSL2 connection**: localhost:6174 accessible
- ✅ **Custom STDIO bridge**: Successfully forwarding JSON-RPC
- ✅ **MCP Protocol**: Server responding with proper MCP format
- ✅ **27 Tools Available**: All your neural AI tools ready

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Cursor doesn't show the server:
1. Make sure you opened Cursor from `C:\neural-mcp`
2. The `.cursor` folder must be in that directory
3. Restart Cursor completely
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for initialization

### If tools don't appear:
1. Must be in **Agent Mode**
2. Ask specifically about MCP tools
3. Check developer console (`Ctrl + Shift + I`) for errors

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When everything is working, you'll see:
- Green status dot in Settings → MCP
- Tools listed when you ask about them
- Cursor can access all 27 neural AI tools
- Can create entities, send messages, etc.
