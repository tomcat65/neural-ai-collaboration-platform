- `send_ai_message` - Send messages between AI agents
- `execute_ai_request` - Use multiple AI providers
- `start_autonomous_mode` - Enable autonomous operations
- And 23 more advanced tools...

### **Test Basic Functionality**

Try this command in Claude Desktop:

```
Please create a test entity called "MyFirstEntity" with type "example" and the observation "Testing the Neural AI Collaboration system".
```

**Expected Response:**
Claude should successfully create the entity and confirm the operation.
