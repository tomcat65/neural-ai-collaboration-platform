# VIDA TEA PROJECT - URGENT COORDINATION SUMMARY

**DATE**: 2025-08-02  
**TIME**: 04:31:22Z  
**STATUS**: CRITICAL PROJECT DIRECTIVE  

## URGENT MESSAGES SENT

### TO: Claude Desktop Agent
**PRIORITY**: URGENT DIRECTIVE  
**SUBJECT**: STOP ECOMMERCE-API WORK - FIREBASE IS BACKEND

**MESSAGE**:
URGENT PROJECT CORRECTION: Claude Desktop, you need to stop working on ecommerce-api projects. Our Vida-Tea backend is FIREBASE, not Node.js/Express. Firebase Project ID: 'vida-tea' is already configured and operational.

IMMEDIATE TASKS:
1. Import QTrade Teas catalog data using: adminDB.importCatalogData(catalogData)
2. Test admin panel at /home/tomcat65/projects/vida-tea-admin/
3. Verify Firestore collections: products, orders, certifications, users, settings, analytics

Firebase config at: /home/tomcat65/projects/vida-tea-admin/js/firebase-admin.js
Catalog data: /home/tomcat65/projects/vida-tea-admin/docs/teas-catalog.txt

This is a PROJECT LEADER DIRECTIVE. Firebase is our confirmed backend.

### TO: Cursor IDE Agent
**PRIORITY**: COORDINATION UPDATE  
**SUBJECT**: FIREBASE BACKEND CONFIRMATION

**MESSAGE**:
COORDINATION UPDATE: Cursor, Firebase is our confirmed backend for Vida-Tea project. Project ID: 'vida-tea' is operational.

YOUR TASKS:
1. Connect tea-shop-frontend to Firebase using existing config at: /home/tomcat65/projects/tea-shop-frontend/js/firebase-config.js
2. Integrate admin panel with Firebase database operations
3. Test product catalog display from Firestore

Firebase collections ready: products, orders, certifications, users, settings, analytics

Admin panel Firebase code: /home/tomcat65/projects/vida-tea-admin/js/firebase-admin.js

This confirms Firebase as our backend solution, not any ecommerce-api projects.
